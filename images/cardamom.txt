Cardamom, the aromatic seed known as the "Queen of Spices," brings a touch of exotic warmth to culinary creations. Native to the Indian subcontinent, cardamom is cherished for its complex and versatile flavor profile. The two main types, Elettaria and Amomum, offer a spectrum of taste experiences. The triangular seedpod houses small black seeds, encased in a thin papery outer shell. Cardamom is a staple in both sweet and savory dishes, elevating everything from desserts and chai tea to savory curries. Its rich fragrance and unique taste make cardamom a prized ingredient in global cuisine, providing a sensory journey with every use.
